# Overview of PyBer_Analysis
The new analysis will show a ride sharing summary by city type for the dates of 1/1/2019 to 4/28/2019. The summary will include the total weekly fares for each city type. This will assist decision makers in better understanding when and where their costs have the most variance and when they are at the highest and lowest rates.

## City Type Summary

*Population increases between city types from rural to suburban to urban. Total rides and fares increase with that population change, in turn requiring more drivers. Average fare per driver and per ride reduce the more populated an area gets. Total fares also increase as an area becomes more populated. This can all be attributed by the supply and demand of rides to the number of drivers.*

*From January to April of 2019 you can visualize the overall trends stated earlier. In addition peak total fares and times of low total fares can be seen based on the dates. Towards the end of February total fares are increasing in all three city types. The lower total fares are occurring at the beginning of January and end slightly higher in each city type by the end of April.*



# Summary

## Business Recommendations

1. Provide discounts on fares at the beginning of the year in all three city types for the month of January to increase number of rides.

2. Determine if getting more drivers in certain rural or suburban areas will decrease the average fare enough that more people would take a ride. Thus increasing the total fares as a whole.

3. Determine optimal average fare per ride and drivers to either encourage more or less drivers per ride.
